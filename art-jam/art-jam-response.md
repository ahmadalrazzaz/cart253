During the Art Jam presentations, I had a chance to check out a lot of creative takes on the assignment. Each one expressed the student’s personal take on a self portrait.

The first project that I saw was from Edmond - https://edmondpeng123.github.io/cart253/topics/art-jam/
 
I really liked the concept of having mini pictures of his face going around in a circle, and I even saw the project before it was completed. He was going through some issues with getting the filters to work when hovering over the moving spheres, but it ended up working fine. I found out that Edmond has a background in graphic design, and therefore incorporated the use of Photoshop in his work. His work was very minimalistic and unique, which I think is how he views himself.

The second project that I saw was from Skyla - https://browneyegirl.github.io/cart253/art-jam/

I really liked the style of this project and how it works with sound. It made me realise just how powerful p5 really is. I spoke with Skyla trying to understand how she achieved this and found out that there are so many different ways to use p5, like implementing sound to control the dots that were drawing her self portrait. Skyla also showed me more work that she used p5 for in her other CART class, and it was using a greyscale version of an image and then populating it with binary from the inputted text. 

Skyla’s project made me want to push myself more and make the effort to learn the different ways that p5 can be used and implement them into future projects.

The third project that I saw was for Sean - https://seangregoryv8.github.io/cart253/assignments/art-jam/

I found this project very cool and interactive, and it inspires me to learn how to achieve something similar. After looking at the code, it makes complete sense and it is something I can personally achieve if I put a bit more effort. I really liked how the eyes follow your cursor (which is something I also implemented) and how you can customize the character by either clicking on the buttons on the sides or by clicking on the eyes and mouth.

I’ve learned many different things from this project. I learned just how much more there is to p5 than I thought. I also feel very inspired now after seeing what my classmates have achieved.

I like what I did with my project, however it is very much on the more technical side rather than the creative side, so I really should start thinking more outside the box rather than just following the instructions exactly as they are.
