I really liked the art style of this project and loved the idea of having it in a window style layout. I'm not sure if the art was made by Norah herself, but eitherway I am such a big fan of how visually consistent it is. The game also plays smoothly and I like the way the UI is arranged - simple, clean and easy to understand without needing extra instructions.

If I was to suggest one improvement, it would be the tongue movement. It feels a bit random at first, but it's just that the tongue moves one click behind the input, which makes it kinda confusing. It shouldn't be a difficult fix, and fixing it would make the whole gameplay feel more polished.

I love everything about this game, it’s so much fun and addictive. I love the art style and especially the idea of how the game is to be played. Everything moves smoothly and interacting with the game feels polished without being overcomplicated. What stood out to me in this project was how minimal it was, yet it felt complete.

Finding something to improve in this game was very hard, but I did find a small bug where if you push the frog all the way to the right, the logs don’t register as getting in contact with the frog, otherwise everything in this game was well put together and was very addictive. (this response took me a while to write because I kept getting distracted playing it lol)

I love how this game works, the art style looks very personalized and I really like how in-depth all the different ghosts are, with their characteristics. I like how the menu design gives a feeling that you are playing a professionally made game and it immediately let me know that this game was going to be very fun. What stood out to me was how detailed everything about this game is, like how the boat drifts when you let go of the key.

One thing I would change is simply the controls for the multiplayer mode, since it uses IJKL, I would have personally used the arrow keys as it feels easier to pick up, but other than that everything is polished and thoughtfully made.


Something that really changed for me throughout this semester up until this project is how I think about creativity. Early on, I focused almost entirely on the technical side of coding, but the more I worked with p5 and the more I saw my classmates exploring ideas in such unique ways, the more I stopped holding back and started thinking more visually. Naturally, I rely on my technical skills, however I am slowly finding the balance.
